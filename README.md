## üìå Project Overview
Lung cancer is one of the most common cancer types worldwide, posing a significant risk if not detected in its early stages. Computed Tomography (CT) scans play a crucial role in early diagnosis; however, manual analysis of these images can be time-consuming and exhausting for medical professionals. Moreover, the chances of effective treatment decrease if an accurate diagnosis is not made at an early stage.

This project aims to develop an AI-powered web-based system for early lung cancer detection using CT scan images. The system enhances diagnosis accuracy by leveraging deep learning models and provides interactive data analysis to better understand cancer risk factors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methods and Workflow

### üìÇ Dataset
The dataset used in this project was sourced from the Hugging Face platform and includes four categories:
- **Adenocarcinoma**
- **Large Cell Carcinoma**
- **Normal (Non-Cancerous)**
- **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**

The system uses the following publicly available datasets:
1. [Hugging Face Lung Cancer Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dorsar/lung-cancer)

---


## üî¨ Data Preprocessing
To enhance model performance, the following preprocessing steps were applied:
- **Image Cropping**: Randomly resized images to **224x224** pixels.
- **Data Augmentation**: Applied random changes in brightness, contrast, and saturation.
- **Format Conversion**: Converted images from `PIL.Image` format to PyTorch Tensor format.
- **Normalization**: Standardized pixel values for improved model efficiency.

---

## üß† Model Training
Several deep learning architectures were trained and compared for performance:
- **ResNet50**
- **DenseNet121**
- **U-Net++**
- **MobileNetV2**
- **CNN (Custom Model)**
- **EfficientNet**

The model used with Fine Tuning to receive AI-supported treatment recommendations and interact with patients like an expert doctor:
- **Gemini-1.5-flash model**

### üèÜ Model Evaluation Metrics
- **Training & Validation Curves**
- **Confusion Matrices**
- **ROC Curves & AUC Scores**
- **Grad-CAM Visualizations**

After comparison, the best-performing model was integrated into the Django web application.

- **FAQ**: A collection of frequently asked questions with detailed answers to help users understand the system better.
- **Contact**: A dedicated form where users can submit feedback, inquiries, or requests for further information.

### üè• **Pages Requiring Login**
- **Data Analysis**: Interactive dashboards and visualizations that provide insights into lung cancer diagnoses, risk factors, and trends using real-time data.
- **Health Assistant**: An AI-powered chatbot trained to provide accurate and up-to-date information about lung cancer, symptoms, prevention, and treatment options.
- **Cancer Detection**: Allows users to upload a CT scan image, enter personal and medical history details, and receive an AI-generated diagnosis along with a confidence score.
- **Prediction History**: A log of all past diagnostic results, where users can view, filter, and download previous analyses for further reference or medical consultations.
- **AI Treatment Recommendation**: A feature that generates personalized treatment plans based on the user's diagnosis, symptoms, and medical history. It includes insights on potential treatment options, lifestyle changes, and disease progression tracking.

üìå **Cancer Detection Page**
 
   Users can get a diagnosis by entering the following information:
- CT Image (Required field)
- Personal Information (Required field)
- Smoking Information
- Past Lung Diseases
- Occupational Exposure
- Symptoms (shortness of breath, weight loss, chronic cough, etc.)

üìå **AI Treatment Recommendation Page**,

   Based on the diagnosis, 
   
- **1. Provides patient-specific treatment options**.

- **2. Makes a comparison with the symptoms and signs** of similar patients.

- **3. Explains the diagnosis methods of the disease and the processes to be followed**.

- **4. Provides information about recommended lifestyle changes**.

- The user can download or share the generated report.

üìå **Health Assistant Page**
- The chatbot provides answers like a chest disease specialist.
